# Data Structures
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.


## Arrays
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.




## Linked List
Linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.



## Stack 
A stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought of as a linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack. ... This structure is used all throughout programming.
linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).



## Queues
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). 


## Hash Tables 
A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched.


## Sets 
A set is a data structure that can store any number of unique values in any order you so wish. Set's are different from arrays in the sense that they only allow non-repeated, unique values within them. ... This will automatically create a set of the unique values in our array for us.



## Binary Trees 

## Tries

## Balancing Binary Trees (AVL Tree)
