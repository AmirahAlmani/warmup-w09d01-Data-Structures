## Binary Trees 

A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.
A Binary Tree node contains following parts:

- Data
- Pointer to left child
- Pointer to right child

## Tries

A trie, also called digital tree or prefix tree, is a kind of search treeâ€”an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.
Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. 

## Balancing Binary Trees (AVL Tree)

AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.

The above tree is AVL because differences between heights of left and right subtrees for every node is less than or equal to 1.
